# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 

Begin by initializing N variables with their respective values.

### Step 2: 

Create n temporary variables to store the current values of the n variables.

### Step 3: 
Use a loop or a systematic process to circulate the values among the variables.

### Step 4: 

Before updating the variables, store their current values in the temporary variables.

### Step 5: 

Assign the values from the temporary variables back to the original variables.

### Step 6: 

Decide whether to repeat the circulation process for a certain number of iterations or terminate based on a condition
